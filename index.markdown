Hi! I'm Matt, a Computer Science student from **Melbourne, Australia**. I've been playing around with computers for the better part of my life --- fueled by a (mostly) healthy obsession of trying to figure out what makes them **tick**. 

At the moment I'm on an endless quest to try and automate **all the things** among other small projects while I finish my degree.
