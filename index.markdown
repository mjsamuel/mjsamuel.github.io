## Hello, World!
I'm Matt, a Computer Science student from **Melbourne, Australia**. I've been playing around with computers for the better part of my life - fueled by a healthy obsession of trying to figure out what makes them **tick**. This lead me to programming, where discovering the countless amounts of languages, processes and tools to learn, along with their endless applications, had me hooked.

At the moment I'm on an endless quest to try and automate **all the things** among other small projects while I finish my degree.
