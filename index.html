    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Matt, a Computer Science student from <b>Melbourne, Australia</b>.  
      I've been playing around with computers for the better part of my life 
      - fueled by a healthy obsession of trying to figure out what makes them <b>tick</b>.
      This lead me to programming, where discovering the countless amounts of languages, processes and tools to learn, along with their endless applications, had me hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment I'm on an endless quest to try and automate <b>all the things</b> among other small projects while I finish my degree.
